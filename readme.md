## Project Details:
### Project Title: Charging Hub
### Cagetory: Open Innovation

### Problem Statement: 
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption grows in Nepal, the charging infrastructure remains disorganized, inefficient, and unreliable. Drivers often lack real-time information about charger availability, face long wait times, encounter non-functional stations, and deal with fragmented payment systems. Meanwhile, station owners struggle with monitoring usage, managing energy loads, and optimizing revenue. Without an integrated and intelligent management system, EV charging networks cannot scale effectively or support the transition toward sustainable transportation.


### Solution Overview: 
Charging Hub is a centralized EV station management platform designed to streamline and optimize the charging ecosystem. It provides real-time charger availability, smart slot booking, integrated digital payments, and seamless QR/RFID-based charging for users. For station operators, it offers a live monitoring dashboard, energy consumption analytics, revenue tracking, and automated fault detection. By combining real-time data, intelligent load management, and scalable infrastructure tools, Charging Hub enhances efficiency, reduces congestion, and supports the sustainable growth of electric mobility.
